# Material_Database


## Tech Stack:
I used the following tech stack:
- Asp.net (.Net 6.0)
- RavenDb Server (inside Docker container at port 8080, pulled latest from docker hub)
- Also Implemented a in memory database for testing the database in parallel to Ravendb
- For frontend I would've used react
- Used Solid (OOP) principle for development

## Current Implementations:
I Implemented the following Functional Requirements:
- Saving Material in the database using a post request
- Retrieving a single record by id or all records using a get request
- Both RavenDb and In memory database are implemented with different DbContext

## Future Implementations:
- Create a Frontend with React Js and Bootstrap
- Create Unit Tests for the Web Api
- Optimizing the code (checking for wrong naming conventions etc)
- Documenting the code (Making the code self explanatory, even though I tried to comment where I can But a separate document would be good or a wiki page here)


I created almost everything today in a total of 3 hours as I was really sick the whole week and I need to take some rest now. But I wanted to show you something on the deadline as I respect the opportunity that you provided me. Hopefully this will at least show you my coding style and we can discuss the project in a meeting a little more.
